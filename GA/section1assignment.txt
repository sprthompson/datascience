# Aim was to see what could predict record sales, based on advertising budget, radio 1 airplay prior to release, and the 'attractiveness' of the band.

data <- read.table("http://www.sagepub.com/dsur/study/DSUR%20Data%20Files/Chapter%207/Album%20Sales%202.dat", h=T)

#ran the multiple regression

model <- lm(sales ~ ., data=data)
summary(model)

# The model would be:
# sales = -26.61 + (0.08 * adverts) + (3.36 * airplay) + (11.09 attract)
# So attractivness is the biggest factor.
# R2 for above is 0.6647, want to check stepAIC R2

step <- stepAIC(model, direction="both")
summary(step)

# it kept them all!

# Will make a model just using attractiveness and them make a poly regression

attract.model <- lm(sales ~ attract, data)

summary(attract.model)

# has R2 intercet 65.510 and coef 18.861, R2 is .1063
# now try polynom

attract.pmodel <- lm(sales ~ poly(attract,2), data)

# intercep 193.2, coefficients> attract 1 371.244, attract 2 -94.107, R2 0.1132
# R2 is better, don't know how to make a formula using those coefficients.
#trying poly 3, 4, 5 gradually makes R2 improve (very small increments).

# now to try lm.ridge

ridge <- lm.ridge(sales ~ ., data)
summary(ridge)
